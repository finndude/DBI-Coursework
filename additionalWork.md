# Additional Work Completed

Below I outline the additional work I did & tests I created. Some of the work was in the spec, but I created a test for it to make sure it works (e.g. People Search with License Number). Some of it was not in the spec and is extra additions I have made (e.g. Checking if ID is an integer). I have created tests for these as well to make sure they work. All is described below.
